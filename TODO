Developers TODO list:
=====================

- Background and graph cell images should be included in the zipped XML archives.
- We should try to see if we can totally prevent the XMLEncoder from looking up bean infos
on the applet codebase
- We should gzip the files uploaded to the server
- When used with MoinMoin wiki, we could restore the map upload. The map file seems OK,
may be that's MoinMoin that doesn't handle it properly, not sure.
- Because og java #4741757 bug, we need to work arround every DefaultPersistenceDelegate
in order it load/save when used in unsigned environment. Things like Gradient are missing
- Swing-Layout Adapter (javax.swing.SpringLayout)
- Port-dialog or -tool for port manipulation
- Move library-entry up/down
- Animated Zoom (see the JUNG graph framework demos, they have a nice working example with this)
- Touch Layout cell-size repulsion
- Mouse Zoom
- Library: edge Source/Target delete if unselected
- New Ruler (see ASSAVID)
- Distribute functions with icons
- Vertical alignment icon

Known Bugs
----------

- Uploading files to the server in applet context is really slow due to bean info lookup on the codebase.
- When (used in applet or web start mode) and usigned, some graph data might not been saved because of java bug #4741757. Gradient color aren't encoded for instance. Workarround: don't use them, writte correct DefaultPersistenceDelegate for them or sign your applet.
- When used in unsigned webstart mode you can save to the local disk but the
user interface of the FileChooser is a bit buggy.
- When loading a file from the Internet, the file name isn't updated in the frame.
- No Live-Preview in Drag Enabled mode on Java 1.4 (JVM Bug!)
	To reproduce this bug, go to the Graph menu and toggle Drag Enabled to true.
	Then drag a selection. Note: No live preview is displayed during drags.
	Compare this to Java 1.3 where the live preview was displayed properly.
- Shift-Vertex-Move does not work in Drag Enabled mode (Shift-Edge-Move does)
- Ctrl-release during move operation applies change on Windows
