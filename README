2.1 Requirements
----------------
JGraphpad is available in different flavors that require the following 
downloads:
o Web Start: JavaTM Web Start (http://java.sun.com/products/javawebstart/) or 
o Application: SDK or JRE 1.4, 1.5 or 1.6 (http://java.sun.com/j2se/) or 
o Applet: JavaTM Plug-In (http://java.sun.com/getjava/)
We recommend Web Start. The most recent version of Java can be obtained 
from http://java.sun.com/j2se/
To build JGraphpad a copy of Ant is required. Ant is available at
http://ant.apache.org/

On the server side, almost anything would fit. But to be able to upload files to the server, you should have 
an HTTP upload service working already (using the POST method).
Warning, HTTPS is not supported out of the box and would require you update the JGraphpad code...

4.1 Tips and Tricks
-------------------
To create multiline labels you can use HTML. Here is an example:
<html>first line<br>second line</html>
The following key bindings are supported by default: 
o Alt-Drag: Force marquee selection
o Shift-Select: Extend selection
o Control-Select: Toggle selection
o Control-Drag: Clones selection
o Shift-Drag: Constrained drag
To add and remove bends (edge points) you can press the right mouse button 
while holding down the Shift key. To use the quadratic and bezier line style 
the edge must have 1 and 2 intermediate points respectively.

5 Extending JGraphpad Community Edition
-------
Since version 5.8, JGraphpad CE has got a plugin architecture. 
You can writte you own plugin and also define which others plugins your app will use. 
Basically, you can use any JGraph subclasser while still benefiting from the framework abilities. 
All actions are overridable via the properties file bundle system. 
But bare in mind that your app should stay licensed under GPL to do so. 
If that's to restrictive to you because you plan to make business, please consider purchasing JGraphpad Pro 
which has a business friendly license and a cleaner and more stable architecture.

To see how you can extend JGraphpad CE, have a look at the Emergy Simulator project here:
http://wiki.visualmodeller.org/EmSim
Warning: at the time you look at this project, it may still be built on an older JGraphpad version; but
that new JGraphpad version has been especially redesigned to cope better with those kind of applications.
