JGraph graph cells and views used in the minimal JGraphpad configuration. Of course, if you provide your own graph cells and views, you could even don't use those files.

<h2>Package Specification</h2>
Those sources can be used with JGraph only. However, JGraphpad need them for its minimal configuration. If you are thinking in implementing other shape libraries, then put them in
a plugin package so that they could be loaded or not.
