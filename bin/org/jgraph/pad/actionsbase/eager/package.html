Contrary to the 'lazy' action package, those action classes are to be preloaded at the jgraphpad startup. The reason is mainly that those action tend to also specify their GUI layout, so they should be loaded at layout time.</p>

<p>
The layout and descrition of the GUI buttons launching those actions is defined in the Graphpad.properties file.
</p>

<p>
You can easily override any of those action by registering an alternative custom class for it in the properties file.
</p>

<p>
In order to speed up the startup, we avoid loading those actions eagerly. We rather dynamically instanciate them when they are triggered.
A fiew of those action files also describe their GUI. In that case, they should be eagerly loaded. That's why there are two packages: 'eager' and 'lazy'.
</p>

<p>
Beware of using threads or even the SwingWorker if you want to launch a GUI non blocking resource intensive action through that pattern.
