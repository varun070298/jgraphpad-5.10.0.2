Microplatform is a generic framework for Internet Rich Clients or Standalone Multi-Document Interfaces (MDI). It can be used to base a wide range of applications, from word processors to diagram editors. This framework has been preferred over the Eclipse RCP or the Netbeans RCP because unlike those framworks it is GPL compliant. Also, more important, that platform has been specially designed to cope with online deployement either via webstart, either via applets and even applet/AJAX mix (I called it BLACKJAX for Background Liveconnected Applet Code Kicking Javanscript and XML). To achieve that, the platform only contains the strict minimum and doesn't force to break the applet or webstart security sandbox because we believe online web services should be safe and should be open to any developper for free. Extended capabilities are injected in that framework using the IOC design pattern (Injection Of Control).

<h2>Package Specification</h2>
THE MICROPLATFORM PACKAGE IS INDEPENDENT FROM JGRAPH AND JGRAPHPAD (it's enforced when compiled by ant). While it does nothing alone, it doesn't need any other package to compile.
