<body>

<p>
The applet code is produced by a javascript helper file. Thus, you aren't tied to a specific server side implementation and even a simple static page (such as this one) is easy to writte.
</p>

<p>
You can have several independent editors in the same page. Here is a first one:
</p>

<div style="width:600">

<script type="text/javascript"><!--
id='editor0' ;
basename='pad0';
xmlDownloadPath='foo';
xmlUploadLPath='foo';
imageDownloadPath='foo';
//--></script>
<script type='text/javascript' src='lib/javascript/firepad.js'></script>

</div>



<p>
By default, the editor expand to the parent DOM available size. You can limit the size like in the first example by putting it into a dim with a fixed size.
</p>


<script type="text/javascript"><!--
id='editor1' ;
basename='pad0';
xmlDownloadPath='foo';
xmlUploadLPath='foo';
imageDownloadPath='foo';
//--></script>
<script type='text/javascript' src='lib/javascript/firepad.js'></script>
